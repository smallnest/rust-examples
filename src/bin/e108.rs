// Idiom #108 Determine if variable name is defined
// Print the value of variable x, but only if x has been declared in this program.
// This makes sense in some languages, not all of them. (Null values are not the point, rather the very existence of the variable.)

// Rust does not have a preprocessor, so there is no way to do this in Rust.
